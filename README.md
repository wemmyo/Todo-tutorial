# To-Do App Tutorial

Welcome to the To-Do App tutorial! In this project, you will learn to create a basic web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them.

## Prerequisites

1. Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Atom).
3. A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

1. Create a user interface using HTML and style it with CSS.
2. Understand and implement basic DOM manipulation using JavaScript.
3. Create, read, update, and delete list items on a web page.

## Features

1. **Add Task**: Users should be able to input a task and click an "Add" button (or press Enter) to add the task to the list.
2. **Mark as Complete**: Users should be able to click on a task to mark it as complete. Completed tasks might have a strikethrough, a changed background color, or any other visual indication.
3. **Delete Task**: Next to each task, there should be a "Delete" button to remove the task from the list.

## Instructions

1. **Setup**:

   - Create a new folder for your project.
   - Inside the folder, create three files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.

2. **HTML Structure**:

   - In `index.html`, set up a basic HTML structure.
   - Add input field for tasks and a button to add them.
   - Create an empty list (`<ul>` or `<ol>`) where the tasks will be displayed.

3. **Styling with CSS**:

   - Open `styles.css`.
   - Add styling to your input field, button, and list. Feel free to get creative with colors, fonts, and other styles!

4. **JavaScript Logic**:

   - In `script.js`, write the logic for adding tasks, marking them as complete, and deleting them.
   - Use event listeners to handle user actions like adding and deleting tasks.

5. **Test**:
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser.
   - Test all the features to ensure they're working as expected.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on building your To-Do App! This is a foundational project that helps solidify your understanding of the basics of web development. As you grow in your coding journey, consider enhancing this app by adding more advanced features or integrating it with backend technologies.

Happy coding!
